# Weather App

The assignment was to create a weather app that would fetch information from an API. We should follow a specific design and have daily and weekly information for multiple days and cities.

## The problem

We divided the project in different groups that would work on specific aspects of it. We faced some difficulties in the Javascript when it came to the weekly forecast, since the API updates gradually, but we applied a solution to hide the day when the information was not available. The CSS was also challenging, since we replicated a specific layout, but with teamwork we were able to do it.

If we would have had more time we would probably focus of doing a special solution for getting the weather forecast for the last day to avoid the data being empty so that the website couldn't load. We would also try to do more of the step.
